# *Musical Tesla Coil*

This project is an implementation of the well-known Tesla transformer. Since the high frequency sparks generated can't really be heard, we thought that we can modulate them with waves in the human spectrum and so we'd create discernible sound, and even melodies. And what cooler way than controlling this with your phone! The app has two main ways of use - purely as an interruptor, meaning - simply outputing frequencies that you can hear, and as MIDI player. 

For more in-depth explanation of the physics behind the Tesla Coil, you can read the documentation below.

## How to download and use / run the project:
  #### Keep in mind that the software itself is coupled with the hardware, so you can either use it with your tesla coil if you have one, or just download it to understand more about how it works.
   - Download Android Studio from here: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Clone this repo using this link: https://github.com/SimeonTsekov/Augmented-Spark.git
   - From Android Studio, click **import project** and navigate to the folder **MidiTeslaCoilApp**
   - Then you can connect your device and click **run**. 

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with it!

## Project is implemented with:
- Android Studio (Intellij-based IDE with Java SDK) for the app. 
- Arduino UNO for receiving logic from the app and signal output to the Tesla Coil. 
- Epic hardware.
